# DCFAKE77

This program turns a Raspberry PI into a DFC77 signal generator. Unlike [the original project](http://www.raspibo.org/wiki/index.php?title=DCFake77:_How_to_radio-control_your_clock_by_yourself) the signal will not be transmitted over the air but one can think of the Raspberry PI as an replacement for a DFC77 receiver one can connect to their electronics project. The DFC77 signal will be provided by GPIO pin 4 (and ground).
